    "content": "\"The Gates of Morning\"\nCHAPTER I\nTHE CANOE BUILDER\nDICK standing on a ledge of coral cast his eyes to the South.\nHis were the canoes drawn up on the sand and his the empty houses where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers.\nAway there,beyond  the sea line, invisible, lay Palm Tree, an island beautiful as a dream, yet swarming with devils.\nLittle Tari the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sitting on the coral close by, looked up at him.\nAnd then, Tari, one day long ago came Katafa, the girl who was blown away from here in a storm.\nShe lived with us till Kearney died and then we two were alone.\nShe taught me her language, which is the language of Karolin.\nThey came to cut the trees.\nKearney would have been quite forgotten but for the little ships he had made as playthings for the boy\u2014who was now a man.\nHe looked down at the questioning child.\n\u201cI am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?\u201d\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d said the child.\nDick turned his gaze again to the north.\nIt might be a very long time yet, but they would come.\nDick was an all but blook, a kanaka, a savage,and yet the white man was there.\nHe could think forward, he could think round a subject and he could imagine.\n\u201cLook!\u201d said Katafa.\nAt big intervals and in certain conditions of weather Palm Tree, though far behind the sea line,became visible from Karolin through mirage.\nThey had threatened him\u2014that was nothing, they had threatened Katafa, that was everything\u2014and they still threatened her.\nSome day they would come.\nThe vision of PalmTree seemed to repeat what instinct told him.\nThey would build canoes and seeing the lagoon mirror-light in the sky, they would come.\nLayout 2."
